## Summary

`dsh-headless` runs one dsh task from the command line and prints the final answer, then exits — no GUI, no server, no browser. Type `dsh --profile headless "run the tests"` and the agent works through the task with the same model, tools, and safety defaults as every other surface. It suits scripts, CI, and one-off jobs: it opens no ports and leaves nothing behind. It also offers a JSON event stream (`--json`) and a caller-chosen identity (`--session-id`). Exit code 0 means the task completed; 1 means it aborted or errored. The boundary: one task per invocation, with no interactive follow-up.

## Use this package

Run one task, get the final answer, and exit. The task is the command-line argument, or stdin when you omit it; the whole invocation is the smallest working example.

### Running a one-shot task

```sh
dsh --profile headless "run the tests"
```

The agent works through the task, streams each non-empty provider reasoning delta to stderr under a `dsh: reasoning:` heading, then prints the final answer on stdout and exits. Consecutive reasoning deltas stay in one section, and the runner closes that section before later output when the provider supplied no trailing newline. A successful run without reasoning keeps stderr empty; a failure exits 1 and prints `dsh: <code>: <message>` to stderr. The task comes from the positional argument, or from stdin when the argument is omitted or is `-`; a blank argument or an empty pipe is rejected before anything runs.

```sh
git diff --stat | dsh --profile headless "summarize these changes"
```

The task and run options are supplied through three settings:

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `task` | stdin | The task text; stdin supplies it when omitted or `-` |
| `sessionId` | `session-<uuid>` | Exact Session identity to adopt or create |
| `json` | `false` | Project the run as newline-delimited events on stdout |

The generated [configuration catalog](../../../docs/config-catalog.md#deepseek-aidsh-headless) is the exhaustive source for every accepted field and its JSDoc.

### Choosing the session identity

Every invocation defaults to a fresh `session-<uuid>` identity. Pass `--session-id <id>` to name it yourself: the runner adopts the persisted Session with that id when one exists, and creates it otherwise. Adoption is scoped to the current working directory and refuses a Session owned by a subagent, so a supervisor cannot silently drive someone else's conversation; either mismatch fails before the task runs.

### Machine-readable output

`--json` replaces the final-text stdout line with a newline-delimited JSON event stream, while stderr keeps only the `dsh:` diagnostics. The stream opens with `session` (carrying the identity the run used) and closes with `final`, and carries `status`, `text`, `thinking`, `tool_call`, and `tool_result` events in between. Streamed text and thinking deltas are coalesced before they are written, and every string is capped at 8 KiB and flagged with `truncated`. A process-level failure outside a turn is reported as an `error` event on stdout in addition to the `dsh:` stderr line.

### When to use it

Use headless for scripted or automated dsh runs — CI steps, batch jobs, quick answers from a terminal. Avoid it when you need a multi-turn interactive session or a GUI; the browser surface ([dsh-web-app](../web-app/README.md)) serves that. The process stays alive only for the run, opens no listening port, and exits on its own, so it fits pipelines that wait on the process. When a supervisor needs progress rather than just the answer, `--json` gives it the event stream and `--session-id` lets a later invocation continue the same conversation.

### Help and task errors

`dsh --profile headless --help` prints the command's help text and exits without running anything. A missing or whitespace-only task is a usage error when stdin is a terminal: nothing runs and the process exits 1. When stdin is not a terminal the runner reads the task from it instead and rejects an empty result the same way.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The runner is a direct driver over the core API carrier: it creates one fresh Agent through the registry and folds the owned durable event interval into one process-level outcome.

### Run flow

The runner awaits the complete application (`ctx.get('loader')?.await()`) so the composed tools and adapters are not half-mounted, reads the shared [`agentDefaultModel`](../../core/agent-default-model/README.md) selection, resolves the task from config or stdin, then creates the exact Agent identity: a fresh `session-<uuid>` by default, or the id `--session-id` names, which it adopts through [`sessionQuery`](../../session-query/session-query/README.md) when a persisted log exists and creates otherwise. It submits the task as an ordinary user message. Without `--json` it streams that Agent's non-empty reasoning deltas to stderr; with `--json` it projects the run instead. It waits for quiescence, then flushes the Session and folds the owned interval (`firstSeq` onward) into the last non-empty `assistant/message` text and final `turn/end` reason. It writes the final text to stdout (or the `final` event) and requests exit.

### Patch surface over base

The patch rides over `dsh-base`: it inherits the projection cache, sets the coding persona prefix and separate cwd suffix on the base `system-prompt` row, keeps the same temporary process-wide PTC mode opt-in (`DSH_TOOLS_MODE`) as the Web surface, disables the shared HMR row, inserts PTC mode's worker as a core execution capability, and mounts the startup provider and the runner. The cache checkpoints each persisted one-shot session for later consumers; its durability barrier flushes each covered log prefix before publishing the cache row and may split otherwise coalesced JSONL runs. The startup provider ([`src/startup.ts`](src/startup.ts)) injects `ctx.cmdlineArgs` ([`dsh-cmdline`](../../boot/cmdline/README.md)), reads the positional argument and the `--session-id`/`--json` options, prints the app's `--help`, and provides `headlessStartup`; the runner injects that service and reads its task and run options from lazy config.

### Exit mapping

A completed final `turn/end` exits 0; any other outcome — aborted, error, or no turn in the owned interval — exits 1. An `error` reason also writes `dsh: <code>: <message>` to stderr. A direct driver failure (for example, Agent creation or an unusable `--session-id`) writes `dsh: <message>` to stderr and exits 1, and in `--json` mode also emits an `error` event.

### Source map

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| [`src/index.ts`](src/index.ts) | The `headless-runner` plugin: run flow, session resolution, output contract, exit mapping |
| [`src/startup.ts`](src/startup.ts) | The `headless-startup` provider: task positional, `--session-id`, `--json`, and `--help` |
| [`src/json-stream.ts`](src/json-stream.ts) | The `--json` projection: event vocabulary, coalescing, string bounding |
| [`cordis.patch.yml`](cordis.patch.yml) | The one-shot patch over `dsh-base` |
| — | No runtime invariant companion is published; the runner's observable contract (provider reasoning on stderr, final text on stdout, exit code by turn-end reason) is process-level and owned by the launcher e2e; it registers nothing and holds no mutable relation to audit inside the tree. |
| [`tests/headless.spec.ts`](tests/headless.spec.ts) | Run flow, aggregation, flush, session adoption, and exit mapping |
| [`tests/json-stream.spec.ts`](tests/json-stream.spec.ts) | Projection ordering, coalescing, bounding, and disposal |
| [`tests/startup.spec.ts`](tests/startup.spec.ts) | Command-line parsing over a real Loader tree |

### Invariant ownership

No invariant companion is published because the runner's observable contract (final text on stdout, exit code by turn-end reason) is process-level and owned by the launcher e2e; the plugin registers nothing and holds no mutable relation to audit inside the tree.

## Model Experience

None, as the runner submits the task as an ordinary user message and the composed base and headless rows own the prompts and tools.

#### KV Cache effect

The runner adds nothing to the request prefix; it only drives one user message through the composed tree.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>


These limits tell you when headless does not fit and what it needs from the `dsh` launcher. They are current package constraints, not a general CLI comparison or a task backlog.

- **One task per run** — after the task is answered the process exits; there is no interactive follow-up, so split multi-step work into separate runs.
- **Runs through the `dsh` launcher** — starting the headless profile another way fails at startup, because only the launcher can request the process exit.
- **No pre-token heartbeat** — in default mode stderr stays silent until the provider emits a non-empty reasoning delta; a delayed first token exposes no earlier progress signal.
- **Reasoning enters stderr logs** — in default mode, redirection and supervisors may retain substantially more and potentially sensitive model output; route stderr to a controlled sink when needed.
- **Default stdout carries only the final answer** — a run without an assistant message prints an empty stdout line and exits 1; intermediate tool output is not printed unless you opt into `--json`.
- **Adoption is cwd- and ownership-scoped** — `--session-id` refuses a Session recorded in another working directory or owned by a subagent, and requires the composed Session query service.
- **The event stream is a projection, not the log** — `--json` coalesces deltas and caps strings at 8 KiB, so it is not a lossless copy of the Session log.
