# Automated pull-request reviews

## Summary

The [`request-review` workflow](../workflows/request-review.yml) requests owners for reviewable code. The [`weighted-approval` workflow](../workflows/weighted-approval.yml) publishes an approval score for branch rules. Both write-capable workflows execute policy from the trusted default branch.

## Routing

Pull requests run the workflow when opened, synchronized, reopened, marked ready for review, or converted to a draft. The scanner fetches the complete pull-request file list, evaluates both paths of a rename, and fails instead of routing from a partial list. GitHub exposes at most 3,000 files for this API.

For a non-draft pull request, the workflow keeps at most one current individual review request other than `@turtle1999`; an existing request for `@turtle1999` does not consume that slot. Each run adds at most one reviewer. An existing non-turtle request leaves no slot, so the workflow does not add anyone, including `@turtle1999`. Existing individual requests consume the slot even when made by people outside the ownership map. When more candidates remain than the available counted slot can cover, the workflow ranks them by the total GitHub-reported additions plus deletions in reviewable changed-file records that match each owner. A rename contributes its changed LOC once to an owner even when both paths match that owner. Higher changed LOC ranks first, and login order resolves ties.

Before selecting a new reviewer, a non-draft run fetches the pull request's complete chronological review list. An owner's latest undismissed decisive review is `APPROVED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; comments and pending reviews do not replace that decision. An approved owner remains omitted after later synchronize events, while a later changes-requested review makes the owner eligible again. The workflow fails before mutation when the list reaches the supported 3,000-review limit or contains an invalid record.

On every run with current review requests, the workflow reads the pull-request timeline. A current reviewer is workflow-authored only when the latest matching `review_requested` event names `github-actions[bot]` as `review_requester`; a request without an attributable event is preserved. On a non-draft pull request, the workflow cancels workflow-authored reviewers that no longer match the current candidates and excess workflow-authored non-turtle reviewers above the counted limit. Current relevance order decides which matching workflow reviewer remains when the limit shrinks. It then fills any slot left by the planned cancellations. On a draft, it cancels every current workflow-authored request. Requests made by people remain unchanged in both states. An attributable event with invalid provenance fails before mutation, and the workflow also fails without cancellation when the timeline exceeds 3,000 events.

The ownership map accepts explicit absolute directory patterns and one or two individual GitHub users per pattern. It rejects wildcards, hidden-directory patterns, teams, more than two owners, and duplicate patterns or owners. Matching follows CODEOWNERS last-match semantics. The scanner prints the changed code, excluded test, documentation, and comment-only files; per-file owner matches and LOC; the aggregate owner relevance ranking; approved owners omitted from new requests; current individual requests and the available counted slot after planned cancellations; and the reviewers it will request or cancel before it mutates review requests. Unmatched files remain visible in the log. The pull-request author, approved owners, and users who remain requested are omitted from new requests.

The policy test measures non-test tracked lines under matched directories and requires `@turtle1999` to own no more than one third of that eligible owned codebase.

## Approval scoring

The weighted approval workflow publishes the `weighted approval` commit status on the pull request head. Branch rules must require this status with GitHub Actions as its expected source; a context-only requirement can accept a same-named status from another integration. The status succeeds at two approval points, remains pending below two points or while the pull request is a draft, fails while a write-capable reviewer has an effective `CHANGES_REQUESTED` review, and reports an error when policy evaluation fails.

Reviewers whose calculated base repository permission is `write` or `admin` count. The [approval policy](approval-policy.json) gives `@07akioni`, `@imccyu`, `@tianyicui`, `@tianyicui-bot`, `@turtle1999`, and `@turtle2099` two points each; every other write-capable reviewer gets one point. The pull-request author and reviewers without write permission do not count.

Each reviewer contributes only the current `APPROVED` or `CHANGES_REQUESTED` decision that GitHub returns. A `DISMISSED` record clears that reviewer's standing decision, including earlier approvals. Comment-only and pending records do not replace a decision. Reviews from deleted accounts and reviewers without current repository access do not count. The workflow does not invalidate an approval by its review commit; the repository's native pull-request rules own stale-review and latest-push requirements.

The publisher runs when a pull request opens, synchronizes, reopens, becomes ready, or becomes a draft. Review submissions, edits, and dismissals run the no-permission [`weighted-approval-review-event` workflow](../workflows/weighted-approval-review-event.yml); its validated run title supplies the pull-request number to the default-branch publisher. The publisher validates the current head, fetches every review, and resolves current repository permission before publishing the status. Permission changes take effect on the next subscribed pull-request or review event.

## Review exclusions

Review routing excludes the repository's unit, end-to-end, expected-output, snapshot, benchmark, performance, stress, corpus, native, and Python test conventions. This includes `test`, `tests`, `__tests__`, `__snapshots__`, `benches`, and `stress-tests` directories; the top-level `benchmarks` and `snapshots` trees; `packages/test-support`; `scripts/fixtures` and `scripts/snapshots`; recognized test filename suffixes; and Python `test_*.py` or `*_test.py` files.

Test infrastructure that can alter how evidence is produced remains reviewable, including `vitest*.config.ts` and gate implementations under `scripts`. A production file named `test.ts`, `spec.ts`, or `snapshot.ts` is not excluded solely by that name.

Files ending in `.md` or `.yaml`, with case-insensitive extension matching, are documentation and never contribute owners. A `.yml` file remains reviewable unless another exclusion applies.

For a modified file with a supported source extension, the scanner compares the pre-change and post-change text after removing parsed comments. It excludes the file only when GitHub supplies a patch whose counted additions and deletions prove that the patch is complete and the remaining code is identical. The parser recognizes C-style line and block comments, hash comments, SQL comments, CSS block comments, and HTML comments for their declared extensions. Renames, unsupported languages, missing or partial patches, and uncertain comment forms remain reviewable.

## Security

The write-capable jobs check out only the repository default branch. They do not check out or execute pull-request code and do not use repository secrets. The review-event workflow has no `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions and passes only a decimal pull-request number in its run title. The publisher rejects an invalid run title and a number that does not resolve to the workflow run's current pull-request head. Pull-request filenames and reviews are treated as API data and escaped in logs.

Ownership and approval policy changes take effect only after they merge into the default branch. This prevents an untrusted pull request from changing either program or policy for its own run.

## Verification

Run `pnpm run test:request-review` for ownership parsing, file classification, complete-patch checks, comment parsing, changed-LOC ranking, pagination, approval-state reduction, logging order, non-draft reconciliation, draft cancellation, reviewer provenance, reviewer filtering, and API behavior. Run `pnpm run test:approval-policy` for policy parsing, effective review decisions, review-event validation, pagination, permission filtering, weighted scoring, blockers, drafts, status publication, and API failures. [Workflow tests](../../scripts/ci-workflow.spec.ts) pin the trusted checkout, no-permission review handoff, permissions, events, and commands. The repository gate graph runs both policy checks and the workflow tests in CI.
