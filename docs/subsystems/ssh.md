# SSH

English | [中文](ssh.zh.md)

The [SSH provider family](../../packages/ssh/README.md) supplies one remote filesystem/process world through a deployment-owned OpenSSH connection. The Harness, model transport and Session storage remain on the host. The family implements the existing filesystem, subprocess and sandbox APIs; it introduces no SSH-specific model tools.

## Execution coordinates

Filesystem identities, executable lookup, process cwd, sandbox workspace roots and language-server file URLs refer to the SSH host. Providers canonicalize paths where the files exist, preserving filesystem interpretation of `symlink/..`. The policy resolver carries absolute execution-world spelling without trying to resolve remote paths on the Harness host.

`processPath()` supplies a path usable by the paired subprocess provider. `processPathFromHostPath()` remains unavailable for SSH; installing a remote artifact does not make an arbitrary host path portable. [`NodeCodeRuntime`](../../packages/code-runtime/code-runtime-node/README.md) therefore takes an explicitly installed, digest-verified remote bootstrap.

## Transport and trust

Administrative RPC uses the helper’s SSH exec streams. Ordinary stdin, stdout, stderr, terminal output and optional fd 7 control traffic use separately authenticated forwarded Unix sockets. Each forwarded stream has its own SSH channel window; paused program output does not share the control or administrative window. All channels still share connection bandwidth and transport failure.

Deployment authentication, installed artifact verification and per-stream TLS authentication belong to [`dsh-ssh`](../../packages/ssh/ssh/README.md). The helper executes filesystem and process requests with trusted local providers on the remote machine. SSH is a transport; the selected remote sandbox provider enforces file effects.

## Process lifetime and cancellation

A process is reserved before its streams are connected, and launch is accepted at most once. `done` reports the direct result; `waitForExit` observes the remote managed range. Terminal operations retain the asynchronous shared API. Preparation cancellation, launched-process termination and provider disposal release their owned resources through the helper.

Administrative deadlines bound individual RPC observations; they do not replace the execution deadline chosen by a Bash or code-runtime consumer. Remote waits can remain pending while other requests progress. SSH loss invalidates pending operations; helper EOF, signals and lease expiry start remote cleanup. The client reports unconfirmed outcomes honestly and never reconnects to replay a possibly executed action.

## Composition scope

Headless records and checks Session cwd through the mounted filesystem provider. Remote FS, Bash, terminal, LSP and PTC consumers can therefore share those coordinates. Web workspace views that assume host filesystem access need separate integration; replacing providers alone does not make those views remote-aware.
